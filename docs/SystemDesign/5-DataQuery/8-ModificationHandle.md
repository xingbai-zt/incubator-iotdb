# Modification handling in query

Background:

Data deletion only record a mods file for disk data, the data is not really deleted. Therefore, we need to consider the modifications in query.

If a TsFile is influenced by deletion, a deletion operation will be recorded in its mods file. The log contains 3 parts: path, deleted time, version

## Related class

mods file: org.apache.iotdb.db.engine.modification.ModificationFile

deletion operation: org.apache.iotdb.db.engine.modification.Modification

## Query process

Each timeseries is treated independently in query process. For each timeseries, there are 5 levels: TsFileResource -> TimeseriesMetadata -> ChunkMetadata -> IPageReader -> BatchData

* TsFileResource -> TimeseriesMetadata

```
// Set the statistics in TimeseriesMetadata unusable if the timeseries contains deletion operations 
FileLoaderUtils.loadTimeseriesMetadata()
```

* TimeseriesMetadata -> List\<ChunkMetadata\>

```
// For each ChunkMetadata, find the largest timestamp in all deletion operations whose version is larger than it. Set deleted time to ChunkMetadata. 
// set the statistics in ChunkMetadata is unusable if it is affected by deletion
FileLoaderUtils.loadChunkMetadataList()
```

E.g., the got ChunkMetadatas are:

* ChunkMetadata -> List\<IPageReader\>

```
// Skip the fully deleted page, set deleteAt into PageReaderï¼ŒSet the page statistics unusalbe if it is affected by deletion
FileLoaderUtils.loadPageReaderList()
```

* IPageReader -> BatchData

```
// For disk page, skip the data points that be deleted and filterd out. For memory data, skip data points be filtered out.
IPageReader.getAllSatisfiedPageData()
```
